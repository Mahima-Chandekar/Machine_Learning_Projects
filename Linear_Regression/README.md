##  *Ames Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regressio*
### This project uses the Ames Housing dataset to build a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on various property features. The aim is to understand key factors affecting housing prices and apply fundamental regression techniques.


##  *Project Overview*

#### --Performed data cleaning and feature preprocessing

#### --Conducted EDA to understand correlations and distributions

#### --Built a Linear Regression model

#### --Evaluated using:R² Score ,Mean Squared Error (MSE),Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
